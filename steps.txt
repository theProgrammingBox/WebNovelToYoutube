Once you finish the tutorial and have the path to the ffmpeg exe files(windows),
If running ffmpeg in your terminal doesnt do what the tutorial does, just paste the path on both
user and system variables.

Make the .env look like this with your own novel url details:
NOVEL_URL = https://someNovel.com/somePath/chapter-
MAX_CHAPTERS = Some number like 100, based on the Novel you are looking for
NOVEL_NAME = your novel name
FFMPEG_PATH = C:\Users\SomeUser\Desktop\SomePath\ffmpeg\ffmpeg.exe
or (choose one based on your custom ffmpeg path)
FFMPEG_PATH = C:\PATH_Programs\ffmpeg.exe (if you used the tutorial)
IMAGE_PATH = ./image/SomeImage.png or .jpg or idk, try out what works for you

if fluent-ffmpeg shows an error, npm i fluent-ffmpeg
